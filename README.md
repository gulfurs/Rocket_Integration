# Rocket Integration
Half Rocket Profile Calculation using Numerical Integration
This project calculates the area under the curve representing the profile (thrust or lift) of a split rocket using various numerical integration techniques. The implemented methods are:

Left Sum
Right Sum
Midpoint Sum
The code integrates three example functions:

Exponential Function
Quadratic Function
Sine Curve
Functions and Integration Methods:

The code defines upper and lower bounds (a and b) for each function. It then divides this interval into a specified number of subintervals (num). The chosen integration method calculates the area under the curve by summing the function values at specific points within each subinterval.
